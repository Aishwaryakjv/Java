A static method is one that belongs to a class instead of an instance of a class and this method can be called without an instance or 
the object of the class. 
If a static keyword is not mentioned before the class name then it is by default a non-static class. 
Non-static methods can access any method that is static and it's variable even without creating an object.
Static methods can access only static variables without object. For accessing non-static variables it requires an object.

In static methods, the memory allocation is done only once since only static methods can access the static variable which happens once at the
time of class loading. Non-static - non-static are also called as instance methods. Everytime a method is called for a particular class instance, 
the memory is allotted.
